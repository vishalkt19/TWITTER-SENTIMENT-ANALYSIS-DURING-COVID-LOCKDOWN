# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-DURING-COVID-LOCKDOWN
I've created a Python application that allows users to input a Tweet, and it leverages an open-source sentiment analysis dataset to identify the sentiment associated with that Tweet. This application combines natural language processing techniques with readily available sentiment data to determine whether the Tweet is generally associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Users can gain valuable insights into public sentiment about a specific topic or keyword, making it a useful tool for monitoring online sentiment trends, social media analysis, and market research. Additionally, the application can be further enhanced by integrating with real-time data sources or more extensive sentiment analysis models for improved accuracy and insights.
